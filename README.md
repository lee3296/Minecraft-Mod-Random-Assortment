# Minecraft-Mod-Random-Assortment
This is a Minecraft that will have random items, crafting recipes, entities, etc. This is mainly to help me learn. But if you want to use this mod in your game time, feel free to use it.

Created using Java and Minecraft Forge.
This was created with 1.18.2 version of Minecraft. Works up to 1.19 version
I am using BlockBench for my 3d models of entities, armor, etc. I literally have no experience in graphic design so they will look really bad.
